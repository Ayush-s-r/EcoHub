 <h2>Why Paper Awareness is Important</h2>
 <p>Paper production is a major contributor to deforestation, water
 pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. By becoming more conscious of our paper use,
 we can make a significant impact on the environment. Awareness leads to action, and
 small changes in our paper consumption habits can lead to big results.</p>
